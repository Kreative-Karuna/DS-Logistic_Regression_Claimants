# DS-Logistic_Regression_Claimants


## Problem Statement

The data contains information on information about the claimant, attorney involvement and the economic loss (LOSS, in thousands), among other variables.

A data frame with 1340 observations on the following 7 variables.

CASENUM- Case number to identify the claim, a numeric vector
ATTORNEY- Whether the claimant is represented by an attorney (=1 if yes and =2 if no), a numeric vector
CLMSEX - Claimant's gender (=1 if male and =2 if female), a numeric vector
CLMINSUR- Whether or not the driver of the claimant's vehicle was uninsured (=1 if yes, =2 if no, and =3 if not applicable), a numeric vector

CLMAGE- Claimant's age, a numeric vector
LOSS- The claimant's total economic loss (in thousands), a numeric vector





**Linear regression**
Linear regression is a ML model that estimates the relationship between independent variables and a dependent variable using a linear equation (straight line equation) in a multidimensional space.

**CRISP-ML(Q) process model describes six phases:**

- Business and Data Understanding
- Data Preparation (Data Engineering)
- Model Building (Machine Learning)
- Model Evaluation and Tunning
- Deployment
- Monitoring and Maintenance
